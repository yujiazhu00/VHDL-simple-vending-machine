# VHDL-simple-vending-machine
<p>A vending machine (finite state machine) by structural modelling in VHDL with testbench. I wrote this while going through <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030124885">Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with VHDL</a> by Brock LaMeres.</p>
<p>This is a slightly improved version of the VHDL code from the textbook in that it locks the dollar bill inlet when coins are inserted into the machine.</p>
